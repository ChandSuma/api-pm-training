# Module 4 - Go Live - Student

**From**: The Boss
**To**: API Product Manager

Hi there!

Good that you released the API to only a few selected clients. That was very good to gather a first round of feedback from the clients that enabled you to realise some wrong assumptions and fine tune the API Contract. That is great!

The excitement is now shared by other teams within the company that want to start using the API in their experiences and benefit from the vouchers functionality.

Now that the API contract is refined, some documentation is available in the API Portal and API Management is ready, it is time to go live for all teams!

Please, make all necessary preparations for a full go-live. We will be in touch again one month after go-live to check how things are going and assess next steps.

Best,

Boss.
