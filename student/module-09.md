# Module 9 - Retirement - Student

**From**: The Boss
**To**: API Product Manager

Hello,

we have reached the state when it is inevitable to phase out and retire some of the endpoints of the API. According to your reports, some endpoints are no longer used by some 95% of API users. Furthermore they are exposing a functionality that we no longer want to offer. Please, prepare the plan to phase out this functionality. Make sure it will not result in drop in user satisfaction / NPS with our APIs.

Regards,

Boss.
