# Module 3 - First Product Iteration - Student

**From**: The Boss
**To**: API Product Manager

Hello there!

I see a lot of progress in the last couple of weeks. You have the approved API product specification, formalised as API description. This verified specification is now our contract for the rest of the API lifecycle. Besides the contract, you also wrote down the non-functional requirements, security, and cost considerations. Finally, you have prepared and groomed the backlog and roadmap. Your fellow developers are ready, so let's start building!

Your task at this point is to deliver the first product iteration â€“ a minimal viable product (MVP) to its first selected clients. What are the steps you need to take during this phase? What would be your work during this initial stage?

The expected result is the MVP conforming to product specifications and delivered to its first users.

Best,

Boss.
