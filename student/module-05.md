# Module 5 - NPS is not our friend - Student

**From**: The Boss
**To**: API Product Manager

Hi there!

As agreed, it is one month since we went live and now it is time to reflect on what goes well and what should improve.

Although we had high expectations for this API, it looks like there are some challenges ahead according to the comments we are getting from the API clients:

-   The documentation is confusing and not well organised. Individual resources are well documented but developers struggle to understand how to make use of all those resources to achieve their use cases.
-   As a result, there are lots of emails and meetings going on between API clients and the API team to clarify questions. I can imagine the same questions are being asked over and over again by different clients.
-   API clients report that they need at least one or two working days to get something useful out of the API. This is very frustrating as, in general, they should be able to get something useful in less than 30 minutes.

Although in general the clients are happy with the API contract design and specification, they are still having a hard time integrating with Vouchers API. The latest developer NPS is -23.

What is your plan to get to a positive NPS?

Best,
Boss.
