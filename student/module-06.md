# Module 6 - Strange usage patterns - Student

**From**: The Boss
**To**: API Product Manager

Welcome back after your well deserved vacation!

Good news! With the API live and after fixing the NPS issues, many client applications are now using the API! However, a new problem has arisen. From our production logs and statistics, we see strange usage patterns of the API. Our users are not using what we thought are the primary endpoints and instead oddly using the operations that we have initially thought of as auxiliary.

The unexpected way of using the API is causing technical issues to the backend team as the database is not optimized for such use. Besides, the way the users call the API might not be the optimal workflow for effectively using the vouchers, issuing new ones, and preventing the issued vouchers from re-use.

The overuse of these endpoints is not only causing technical difficulties like slow response times, but I suspect it might negatively affect the business impact of the vouchers API.

Can you please take a look into the issue and suggest what we should do?

Best,
Boss.
