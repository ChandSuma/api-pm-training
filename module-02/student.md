# Module 2 - Product Specification - Student

**From**: The Boss
**To**: API Product Manager

Hi There,

I'm glad to see that you have identified the use-cases for the planned Voucher API and articulated hypotheses about their business values. Let's now turn these into a product specification for the development team!

With use-cases and vocabulary consolidated, it is time to prepare everything so that your fellow developers can start working. Please, take into account that the preparation should cover not only the technical specification of the product you hope to create but also everything related to it including business, security, and any compliance consideration. To help you with the technical part of designing an API product, an experienced architect is ready at your hand. You should reach out to her to help you with the architectural aspects of the product. Do not forget that we have the adidas API guidelines [https://adidas.gitbook.io/api-guidelines/](https://adidas.gitbook.io/api-guidelines/) to provide some cue points along the API product lifecycle.

Ready to start? Make sure that the output is a tangible API product specification for developers as well as the plan of how to execute the delivery. What else do you think is needed before you can start building the API?

Best regards,

Boss.
