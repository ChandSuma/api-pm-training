# Module 7 - API Evolution - Student

**From**: The Boss
**To**: API Product Manager

Hi there,

It is very good to see that we approached our clients to understand their pain-points and figure out the reason for the weird usage patterns. I see you collected some proposals to evolve the API design based on that feedback. I find it risky to change the API contract given that we have already some clients using it in production. Are you confident we can evolve the API in a way we don't disturb our clients? What is your approach to evolve the API in a way we don't break things?

Looking forward to your proposal.

Best,
Boss.
