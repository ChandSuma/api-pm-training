# Module 5 - NPS is not our friend - Instructor

A technically well crafted API design is a necessary element of success but it is not enough at all. Making the API easy to consume is far more difficult and a significant investment is needed in that sense.

Those are some of the activities to perform in order to overcome the challenges:

## Expected Outcome

### Gather feedback from unhappy clients (Strategy & Roadmap)
One of the most important activities for a Product Manager is to identify and setup the right feedback loops to gather how users perceive the product and how well it meets their expectations. When the environment of the product is small, gathering feedback can be as simple as having face-to-face conversations. As the solution scales, the API Product Manager has to decide on the mechanisms to use to incorporate feedback from multiple parties geographically distributed. This may take multiple forms:
- API usage analytics via API gateway or logging information to track whether usage in increasing or decreasing.
- Web analytics in API portal to track how documentation is being used.
- Offer documentation rating in API portal, e.g. rate this page, is this tutorial useful, etc.
- Offer channels to quickly answer questions or receive feedback: Q&A forums or chat channels.
- Regular on-line feedback surveys.

### Document the API from a use case point of view (Documentation)

Documenting individual resources is necessary, but it is not less necessary to understand the use cases and consumer journeys in which your API will be used. A list of use cases and how to fulfil those use cases via the API is a must-have in a good API documentation. The following sections should be expected in any high-quality API documentation:
- Use case driven tutorials on how to achieve a particular outcome using the API, both in written or as video tutorials.
- Sample code in different programming languages.
- Example calls/responses in tools like Postman.

Keep in mind that the effort of generating excellent documentation is comparable to the effort of developing the API itself. The "Technical Writer" is a recent job role that appeared in the market to fulfil the need of generating high quality documentation for digital products.

A good way to test the documentation is to have a developer not familiar with the API build a client that uses a non-trivial use case in less than 30 minutes.

### Accelerate adoption with development tools (Development tools)

Additional development tools can be offered to developers to accelerate adoption:

-   SDKs in different programming languages that can take care of low level HTTP interactions .
-   Sandboxed environments in which developers can try-out the API without side effects.

### Offer a support structure (Support)

Support capabilities are part of the API offering. We need to be ready to support the developers/architects using our APIs with different communication styles:
- Frequently asked questions
-   Forum like Q&A capabilities to store and search previous questions/answers.
-   Chat-based support for urgent queries that require real-time interaction.
- Traditional case-based support flow.
