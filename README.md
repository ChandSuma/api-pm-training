# adidas API Product Owner Training

Training materials for API product owners at adidas.

The training is meant to be conducted by an instructor. It is following the "learnign by doing" methodology with big emphasis on students solving new problem for the first time with the coordination from the instrucutor. The lecture is split in modules each module representing different area of responsibilities for a product owner.

The actual content of the lecture is in the [student](/student) and [instructor](/instructor) folder. 

**Students are asked to NOT read the instructor materials until after the training.**


## Introduction to the training 

Instructor welcome students and prepare an ice breaker: https://www.snacknation.com/blog/boost-productivity-meetings-icebreakers-games.

The instructor then explains the API Transformation initiative in Digital IT and why the practice of API Product ownership is necessary to successfully drive the initiative.

## Dynamics

Students should be grouped in teams of 3 people ideally. At the beginning of each module they will receive the student "message" which simulates an email from their line manager asking them to produce an artefact.

Students are expected to have a time-slotted discussion of around 15-20 minutes in which they will decide the actions that should be taken to produce the artefacts. They are not expected to actually produce the artefacts, just a step by step guide explaining how would they do it.

All relevant action points identified by them should be written down in post-its. After 20 minutes the teams would expose how would they proceed to produce the artefacts and what are the key elements to watch out for. No challenging happens at this time, everybody listens.

After all teams have exposed their proposals, facilitators will help the teams to assign their proposals to one of the seven areas of investment for an API Product:
