# Module 8 - Dimensions of success - Instructor
An API has several dimensions to report on for business, IT or both. Let's take a look at some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Another element to take into account is that some of the metrics can be applied to the whole API, a subset of it, individual resources, etc. And even we could split the reporting by geographical regions or specific clients of the API (you may have different SLA agreement with different clients).

## Expected Outcome

### CFO Lens

#### Direct and Indirect Revenue

Capture the revenue for the sales of core products that are enabled by APIs.

#### Cost Reduction

It can be hard to initially measure cost reduction from APIs. But significant cost reductions are usually realised from the rise in API reuse. When APIs are part of a broader internal refactoring of value chains, use this target together with related metrics such as increased use of backends.

The effect is even more pronounced when IT capital investment shifts to a small set of highly capable, commercial-off-the-shelf platforms. Instead of taking time and money to build open-source platforms, the enterprise teams can focus on creating new business value on top of these platforms at much lower cost and faster time to market.

#### KSR Cost (Keep System Running)

What are the KSR costs for keeping the API up and running?

### DevOps Lens

#### Availability

Successful  HTTP  requests vs Total  HTTP  requests

#### Performance

HTTP  requests  below  reponse  time  Threshold vs Total  HTTP  requests

#### Error budget
Compliance with error budget for a certain period of time.

#### Number of incidents

Inform on the number of incidents and its categorisation.

#### SLA adherence

How well is this API respecting its SLA commitments?

### CMO Lens

#### Number of client applications

How many client applications are using the API?

#### Number of requests

How much traffic is your API dealing with?

#### Developer NPS

Use this or a similar target to gauge the app developers who are adopting and calling APIs from within their apps.

#### Speed to onboard

The portal by which front-end developers obtain access to your APIs should feature an automated approval process, including self-service onboarding capabilities that let developers register their apps, obtain keys, access dashboards, and discover APIs.
