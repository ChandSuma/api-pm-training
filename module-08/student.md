# Module 8 - Dimensions of success - Student

**From**: The Boss
**To**: API Product Manager

Hi there,

First of all, congratulations for the release of the new API version with no client disruption. We have certainly reached a very high level of maturity. The good news is that the expected business benefits are now starting to materialise and some management stakeholders both in business and IT would like to be regularly informed.

The point is that I'm constantly getting the question "how is the API doing?". I need your help in preparing a structured reporting. From your point of view, which are the key dimensions to report on to both business and IT management? How can we provide such a report?

Best,

Boss
