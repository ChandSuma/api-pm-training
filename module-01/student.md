# Module 1 - The Business Challenge -  Student Guide

**From**: The Boss
**To**: API Product Manager

Welcome to the team! We are really excited that you joined our company. Our API Platform is still in early days but already showing some promising results. In order to continue our evolution we need to onboard a new API: the Vouchers API.

There is a need in the company to streamline the management of vouchers and discounts. Today, different business teams are dealing with vouchers and discounts:

*   Our Partner Commerce team creates vouchers for business partners to reward their loyalty or as a compensation mechanism whenever we are not able to deliver as per our quality standards.
*   Our e-commerce Consumer Service team creates discount vouchers for consumers as a compensation mechanism when there are issues or complains around deliveries.
*   Our e-commerce business team regularly creates campaigns for "Friends & Family" or special occasions which imply the use of a discount code not linked to specific individuals.
*   Our HR colleagues manage employee discounts.

The challenge is not only the fact that different teams are somehow working with vouchers and discounts, but also the business rules that should govern the use of those vouchers. Many times there are conflicts among them that are impacting our revenue and margin. For example, vouchers being used multiple times, which gets unnoticed. Or the same voucher being used in retail and e-commerce. Not to mention all the new experiences that want to incorporate voucher capabilities but have to align with many different teams and stakeholders to make sure a consistent user experience is delivered.

All in all, a very clear scenario in which we need to consolidate the business rules around vouchers and productise them via an API so that any experience can embed voucher capabilities in a self-service way, independent of the business model: business to business or business to consumer.

We want you to lead this effort as your first assignment in our company. In my opinion, we should first come up with a list of use cases and a first assessment of their business value. Does it work for you to have that in three weeks time? Please, block my calendar accordingly to review the result of your work and we will take it from there.

Again, I'm really excited that someone with your skills and experience joined our team of API Product Managers. Welcome again!

Best Regards,

The Boss.
